# RNN-Bearing-Fault-Detection
Bearing Fault detection via a recurrent neural network using bearing acceleration data provided by the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), University of Cincinnati, published by the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence.

Utilization of data sampling, parameterization, and RNN as well as ANN to detect bearing defects. Optimization via a parametric sweep is performed to determine the best NN structure (number of layers and nodes).
